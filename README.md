# gulp/Grunt Starter

gulp/Grunt Starter is designed to quickly get a front-end development environment up-and-running.

gulp is the default setup, but if you prefer to use Grunt, you can! (more information on using Grunt in [Installation](#installation)).

## Setup

Here’s what I have set up:

- Sass
- Autoprefixer
- ESLint
- Concatenate JavaScript
- Sourcemaps
- Watch and rebuild Sass and JavaScript
- Browsersync
- CSScomb, Minify CSS and JavaScript

## Installation

*__Note__: If you want to use Grunt instead of gulp, replace `package.json` with `package.grunt.json` (discard the original `package.json` or rename it to `package.gulp.json`).*

1. Be sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed
2. Clone this repo (`git clone git@github.com:jonsuh/gulp-grunt-starter.git`) or download and unzip
3. `cd` to the repo directory (e.g. `cd ~/repos/gulp-grunt-starter`)
4. Run `npm install` (you may have to run it with sudo: `sudo npm install`)

You’re ready to roll!

To test it out, run `gulp` (or `grunt`), point your browser to `localhost:3000`, and make changes to a Sass or JS file, and watch gulp/Grunt work. 

## Tasks

- `gulp`  
Default, development task that runs the build task, then watches for changes and enables Browsersync.

- `gulp build`  
Build task that autoprefixes and compiles Sass to CSS, lints and concatenates JavaScript.

- `gulp dist`  
Production task that runs the build task, CSScomb’s the CSS, then minifies the CSS and JavaScript

If you’re using Grunt, just replace `gulp` with `grunt` in the above tasks:
```
grunt
grunt build
grunt dist
```

## `gulpify` Bash function

Since this project is something I use personally, I created a Bash function `gulpify` to use this repo to quickly get a project up-and-running.

I simply run `gulpify project-name` and it clones the repo in directory project-name, cd’s to the new directory, modifies/remove any files I don’t need, and runs `npm install`.

Put the following in your `~/.bash_profile` or alike:

```
gulpify() {
  if [ "$1" ]; then
    git clone git@github.com:jonsuh/gulp-grunt-starter.git /path/to/projects/$1
    cd /path/to/projects/$1
    # rm Gruntfile.js package.grunt.json
    sudo rm -R .git
    npm install
  else
    echo -e "ERROR: Specify a directory name to gulpify."
  fi
}
```

Replace `/path/to/projects/` with your working (project) directory.

Uncomment and modify the commented-out line (`# rm Gruntfile.js...`) with commands that you’ll be running to remove/modify files that prior to running `npm install`. For example, this project prefers gulp; however, if you want to use Grunt, you’d want to remove the existing `package.json` and rename `package.grunt.json` to `package.json`, so you may want to modify that line to something like this:

```
rm gulpfile.js package.json && mv package.grunt.json package.json
```

Restart Terminal (or reload `~/.bash_profile` by running `source ~/.bash_profile`).

Then run `gulpify project-folder-name`, and voila.

You can also rename the function to whatever you’d like by replacing line 1 `gulpify()` to `callitwhateveryouwant()`.

## Notes

- Point your browser to `localhost:3000` and make a change to a Sass file to see Browsersync in action.
- To add or remove concatenated JS files, look in lines 62 and 63 of `gulpfile.js` (or 80 and 81 of `Gruntfile.js`).
- Config files (`.csscomb.dist.json`, `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc`, `bs-config.js` and `config.postcss.json`) are shared by gulp and Grunt.
- Browsersync’s config file `bs-config.js` is configured to serve from the root directory (`./`) and refresh CSS changes. More details on [configuring Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/).
- CSScomb’s config file `.csscomb.dist.json` is configured for production (`dist` tasks). If you are planning on using CSScomb during development (or) to enforce CSS/Sass formatting, you should create a `.csscomb.json` in the root of your project and configure it accordingly (this will not affect the `dist` tasks since they are specifically looking for the `.csscomb.dist.json` file). More details on [configuring CSScomb](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js/blob/master/doc/options.md).
- ESLint’s config file `.eslintrc` is configured to use the `eslint:recommended` configuration, and is slightly extended. More details on [configuring ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).
