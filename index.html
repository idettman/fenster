    <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
    <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>

    <p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
    <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
    <p>I'm trying not to, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I'm trying not to, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Don't underestimate the Force.</p>
